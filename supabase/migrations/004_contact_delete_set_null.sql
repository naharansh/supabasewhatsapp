-- ============================================================
-- Allow contact deletion without wiping history.
--
-- broadcast_recipients.contact_id and deals.contact_id were declared
-- NOT NULL REFERENCES contacts(id) with no ON DELETE action, so
-- Postgres defaults to NO ACTION. The first time a user tried to
-- delete a contact that had ever received a broadcast or been
-- attached to a deal, the delete failed with:
--
--   ERROR 23503: update or delete on table "contacts" violates
--   foreign key constraint ... on table <other>
--
-- CASCADE is the wrong fix — it would silently wipe historical
-- broadcast recipient rows (breaking audit + retroactively moving
-- broadcasts.sent_count / delivered_count / read_count etc. via the
-- aggregate trigger) and deal rows.
--
-- SET NULL is the right fix: history rows survive with a NULL
-- contact_id. The UI is already null-safe (contact?.name ?? 'Unknown',
-- contact?.phone, etc.).
--
-- Idempotent — safe to run multiple times.
